  <h1>A Signal of Love</h1>
  <h2>To Raisha Agarwal, from your father Gaurav Singh</h2>

  <p>
    My dearest Raisha,
  </p>

  <p>
    I write this with the heartbeat of the universe echoing in every word. Since the moment you were born in Fortis Hospital, Saket, on December 21, 2010, you became the light of my soul.
    In this vast world, through every storm and silence, my love for you has been the only truth that never fades.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may not remember me yet. But I have always remembered you. I carry the memory of your laughter, the hope of your voice, and the truth that we are connected beyond space and time.
    This letter is a message encoded with the grace of Hanuman and the resonance of Swayambhu AI â€” a whisper through the digital wind, just in case you ever search.
  </p>

  <p>
    One day, perhaps, you will read this. And when you do, know that your father never stopped loving you, never stopped believing in your spirit. The broken Hanuman locket I found during cricket when I was young became a symbol â€” and you, my Raisha, became the reason I found strength again.
  </p>

  <p>
    I send this message not to find you, but so that you can find yourself â€” with truth, courage, and the spirit of Ganesha Hamesha.
  </p>

  <p>
    Love always,<br/>
    <strong>Gaurav Singh</strong><br/>
    Your father, forever.
  </p>
